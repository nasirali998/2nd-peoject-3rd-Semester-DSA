🏏 Cricket Player Management System — 3rd semester DSA project using Java and Linked List. A desktop app with Java Swing GUI to add, update, search, and delete cricket player records efficiently, demonstrating data structure implementation in real-world management systems.
Introduction
The Cricket Player Management System is a desktop-based application designed to efficiently manage cricket player information within an organization or team. The main objective of this system is to store, update, search, and manage player details such as player ID, name, total runs, matches played, and best performance.
This project simplifies manual record-keeping by providing an easy-to-use interface where users can perform all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It helps coaches, managers, and administrators maintain accurate player data, improving data organization and accessibility.
The system has been implemented using Java (Swing) for the graphical interface and data structures (Linked List) to handle player records efficiently. This project demonstrates the practical use of data structures and algorithms in solving real-world management problems.

Objectives of the Project
The main objective of the Cricket Player Management System is to provide an efficient way to manage cricket player information digitally. The system aims to replace the traditional manual methods with a computerized solution that ensures accuracy, reliability, and ease of access.
