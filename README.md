🚀 Overview

The Cricket Player Management System is a desktop-based Java application built using Java Swing and Linked List data structures.
It provides an efficient and user-friendly way to manage player information such as ID, name, total runs, matches, and best performance.

This project demonstrates how data structures and algorithms can be applied to build real-world management systems. It replaces manual record-keeping with an organized, digital solution for cricket teams, coaches, and administrators.

🎯 Objectives

Build a GUI-based system to manage cricket player records efficiently.

Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

Use Linked List to handle data dynamically.

Minimize manual errors and duplication.

Provide fast, accurate, and accessible player data management.

🧠 Core Features

🔐 Login System: Secure authentication using username and password.

🏠 Dashboard: Central hub for navigation and module access.

➕ Add Player: Add new player records with auto-generated unique IDs.

🔍 Search Player: Quickly find player details by ID.

✏️ Update Player: Modify existing player data with validation.

🗑️ Delete Player: Remove player records safely from the system.

📋 View All Players: Display all stored player information in an organized list.

💾 Data Handling: Uses doubly linked list for efficient record management.
